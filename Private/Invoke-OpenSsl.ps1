function Invoke-OpenSsl {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Invoke the openssl command-line tool and capture its output.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Centralized wrapper for openssl. Builds a System.Diagnostics.Process with
        stdout/stderr redirected so callers receive the result in any PowerShell
        host (including ISE, VSCode terminal, remoting sessions, and CI). On a
        non-zero exit code the function emits a terminating error unless
        -IgnoreExitCode is supplied (used by probing callers such as Test-Cipher
        and Test-Protocol where a non-zero exit is an expected outcome).
    .PARAMETER ArgumentList
        Arguments to pass to openssl. Each element is a discrete argv entry; do
        not pre-join into a single string and do not wrap values containing
        spaces in quotes. Quoting is handled by ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList.
    .PARAMETER IgnoreExitCode
        Return the result object even when openssl exits non-zero. Callers must
        inspect the ExitCode property themselves.
    .PARAMETER EnvironmentVariable
        Dictionary of environment variables to set on the openssl child process
        only. Use this to hand sensitive values (e.g. PFX passwords) to openssl
        via -passin env:VAR / -passout env:VAR instead of pass:..., which would
        place the secret on the command line where it is visible to process
        listings, EDR telemetry, and audit logs. SecureString values are
        unwrapped just-in-time inside the helper. The variables are NOT
        propagated to the parent PowerShell session.
    .INPUTS
        None.
    .OUTPUTS
        System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject with ExitCode, StdOut, StdErr.
    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Invoke-OpenSsl -ArgumentList 'version'
        Runs 'openssl version' and returns a result object.
    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> $r = Invoke-OpenSsl -ArgumentList @('s_client', '-cipher', $c, '-connect', "$h`:443") -IgnoreExitCode
        PS C:\> if ($r.ExitCode -eq 0) { 'supported' } else { 'not supported' }
        Use -IgnoreExitCode for probing scenarios where a non-zero exit is meaningful, not fatal.
    .NOTES
        Status: Stable
        - Internal helper. Not exported from the module.
